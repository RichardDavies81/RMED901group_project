# Script for data analysis of data from tidy data generated in setup.R script

# note- each person chooses one question

# Do your chances of getting a positive test increase with the number of tests taken?


# Are there more positive tests in the drive-through?



# Is the age of the individual associated with whether the test result is negative or positive?



# Is there a difference in the distributions of `ct_results` between different outcome groups (`result`)?



# Does the number of positive tests depend on the `pan_day`?
